# What is Google Colab and Colab Notebook?

### Interactive Notebooks

* We are humans and always need user-friendly applications. Notebooks are typically used by data scientists for quick exploration tasks. In that regard, they offer a number of advantages over any local scripts or tools.  
* The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. 
* Now, how do we use Jupyter Notebook?

### Google Colab

Now, how do we use Jupyter Notebook?

* The simplest way for getting started is not getting worried about installing anything at all. 
  * Google offers **Google Colab** notebooks \(also called as online version of Jupyter notebook\) that is easy-to-use and interactive data science environment.
  * Not just that, Google colab offers you upto 25 GB ram/GPU etc for free and 100 GB storage.
  * So, you don’t need to worry about installing a bulky python local application on your laptop/computer

### Installing Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda

* There is another way of using Jupyter Notebooks i.e by installing the required packages in your device. We have also provided you resources for the same. You can find them in the last few topics of this module and listed as \[Optional\].

NOTE: If you are a beginner and just starting out, we recommend going with Google Colab. It has all the things you need with such good GPU availability. We don’t want to get in the hassle of installations right now, do we? :P

Once you get comfortable, feel free to dive into the installation anytime later.

### **Online Environment to Run Python Code**

There seems to some issue with visibility in the video with print function. Print function is usually used as follows print\(z\)  However, in the video it appears to be print.\(z\). due to screen recording  issue, so please use the correct one i.e print\(z\)
