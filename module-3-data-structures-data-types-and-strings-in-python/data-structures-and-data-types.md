# Data Structures and Data Types

* If you’re learning Python from multiple sources, you might encounter the terms data structures and data types being used interchangeably. \

* **Definition: **Data structure is a general computer science concept. Its definition reads as follows on Wikipedia:\

* **Data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.** More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\

* Whereas Data type is a concept specific to a programming language. In a way, it is a concrete implementation of a data structure in a particular programming language (be it python or any other language)\

* **The actual definition of what constitutes a "type" varies among programming languages. **Talking about Python, there are basic data types like int, float, string etc. You can use the built-in types like list, set etc. which we will be covering in this session.\

* Calling these data types as data structures won’t be wrong because there is no major difference between the two in Python.

### Data Types in Python

* Before we proceed to discuss what data types in Python are, there are some basic questions that we would discuss.** What is data? **\
  ****
* Let’s say you are going to meet a friend at her office. When you go to visit her office, the security guard asks you to make an entry in the register before you enter the office. A typical entry register asks for the following information –

| **Visitor's name** | **Visitor's phone number** | **Visitor's address** | **Entry time** |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| **Karen**          | **32 000 000**             | **Leuven**            | **8:30 AM**    |

* The above information that you just provided is data. \

* We see that the data entry in the previous slide has different varieties: 
  * Some are english letters, 
  * Some are numerical digits, and 
  * There are some special characters, dash (-) and colon ( : ).  
  * In this example, our data is divided into 4 categories – name, phone number, address, and time. 
  * This** categorization of data**,** **based on their characteristic & our need,** **is called** data types.**\
    ****
*   Some of the data types in python include: 

    * Integer: whole numbers, positive or negative numbers. Eg: 100
    * Float: Floating-point numbers are real numbers, rational or irrational. In most cases, this means numbers with decimal fractions. Example: 123.45

    String: Strings are sequences of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. Example: "any text", “karen”\

### **Getting the Data Type**

You can get the data type of any object by using the type( ) function:

* **Numerical Types: **int (integer), float (decimal)
* **Text Type: **str (string)
* **Boolean Type:** bool (True or False)
