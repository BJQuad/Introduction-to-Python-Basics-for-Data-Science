# Introduction & Implementation Of List in Python

* As the name suggests,** List is an ordered sequence of data. In real life, if you could make a list of things that come to your mind **(or event for any specific purpose), it could be something like this –  
  * Brush
  * Leuven
  * 48851964400
  * 3.14
  * Mom\

* **Well, this is my list. You could make your own list & include whatever you want in it. **So, in my list, I have included what I do early in the morning, the city I live in, my mobile number, the value of pi to two digits, and mom. It has different types of data – strings, float, and integer. \

* **Well, this is the kind of flexibility Python List provides. It can hold different types of data types. Declaring a List is fairly straightforward. You use square bracket (\[]) and separate the items by a comma. **Let me write an example - \
  \
  ****A = \["Brush", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"] \

* **Lists are mutable. **Say if you want to change some item on a List, you can do that. For example, if I don’t like  ‘Brush’’, and want to replace this with ‘Morning Walk’, I can do it –\
  \
  A = \["Morning Walk", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"] \
  ****
* Some** essential features **of Python lists are:
  * Collection of values
  * Can be of any data type
  * Can be a combination of different types

**Note: **The tutor in this video used python console. Nothing to worry here, you can use the same code and run it on jupyter notebook too.
