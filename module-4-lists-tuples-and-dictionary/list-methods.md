# List Methods

### **.append\(\)**

In Python, you can add values to the end of a list using the .append\(\) method.

### **count\(\)**

The .count\(\) Python list method searches a list for whatever search term it receives as an argument, then returns the number of matching entries found.

### **len\(\)**

The Python len\(\) function can be used to determine the number of items found in the list it accepts as an argument.

### .sort\(\)

The .sort\(\) Python list method will sort the contents of whatever list it is called on. Numerical lists will be sorted in ascending order, and lists of Strings will be sorted into alphabetical order. It modifies the original list, and has no return value.
