# Introduction & Implementation of Dictionary in Python

* Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.  
* Real word dictionaries are a good analogy to understand them: they contain a list of items\(words\), each item has a key\(the word\) and a value\(the word’s meaning\). 
* It generally is used when we have a huge amount of data.  
* It is defined within braces with each item being in the form of key: value pair. Syntax –`my_dict = { "key1":"value1", "key2":"value2", }`

* The keys in a dictionary must always be unique and immutable. This is the reason dictionary keys can be String but not List. 
* On the other hand, Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated 
* Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
