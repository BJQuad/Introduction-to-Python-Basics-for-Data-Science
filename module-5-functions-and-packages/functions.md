# Functions

* This something we have been indirectly using since the first module.
* print( ) and input( ) are some functions that you’ve already used. And these are inbuilt functions. \
  `print ("hello world")`\
  `input ("enter your age")`
* If you want, you can even create your own function to get some desired output.
* Let’s learn some in-built functions in the video mentioned below.
